[Click here](https://howmuch.net/articles/best-college-on-each-state-2019) to see the original data visualization.

I chose this visualization because, although the image looked colorful and creative, it was difficult for me to extract information from this visualization. I could see from this visualization that there were a lot of things that can be improved, at least to make all the data clearer. 

Inspired by the critique method, I realized that the visualization was not well done in terms of usefulness, perceptibility, and intuitiveness. It did not allow people to easily compare data to generate useful insights. The colors used for classification were too close. Using the school's school badge to indicate the name of the school made the information unclear. According to the critique method, I think this type of graph may not be appropriate in this data visualization. The audience for this chart was likely to be some students or parents who needed to choose a school. They preferred to see comparisons among schools. Thus, if I would redesign this visualization, I might choose simple bar chart to show the data clearly and make the data comparable. I would also display the name of the school and state to indicate which school and state the data belonged to. In addition, I would sort the bar chart to make it easier for comparison. 

The picture below was my first wireframe. I tried to use the overlapping bar charts to represent the salary and expenses of the graduates. I showed this wireframe to my friends and made some notes that needed to be changed on the graph.

I asked the following questions to my friends.
-	Can you tell me what you think this is?
    - A: The correlation between the net price and average salary?
     - B: Which school graduates can get the highest salary?
-	Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
    - Both: Those graduates from Stanford in CA got the highest salaries.
-	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  - Both: U.S. Air Force Academy doesnâ€™t require any tuition fee?
  - A: What is net price? What does the average early career salary mean?
-	Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
  - Both: Students who want to select schools.
-	Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  - A: I will show the unit of y-axis more clearly.
  - B: I might change the color.

Also, when they were doing the review, I noticed that they were both struggling with observing the x-axis. To conclude, the change I would make to the visualization were:
-	Add a clear title.
-	Change the name of the indicator to a more understandable one.
-	Show units in the axis.
-	Convert the X-axis and the Y-axis.
-	Reduce the colors.

The graph below was my first prototype of the data visualization. I followed the critique method and create this visualization to show the data in a clearer way. I used a bullet graph to show the net cost and salary simultaneously.
